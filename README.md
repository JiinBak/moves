## Moves

[moves.cfapps.pez.pivotal.io](https://moves.cfapps.pez.pivotal.io)

This application demonstrates real-time model scoring as a service Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF), Pivotal Big Data Suite, Spring Cloud Data Flow, and Python-based open source machine learning. The pipeline applies broadly and would allow us to evaluate and score almost any feed of streaming data - from sensor data to unstructured text data - to drive real-time action.
